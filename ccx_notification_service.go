// Entry point to the notification service.
//
// The purpose of this service is to enable sending automatic email
// notifications and ServiceLog events to users for all serious issues found in
// their OpenShift clusters. The "instant" mode of this service runs as a
// cronjob every fifteen minutes, and it sends a sequence of events to the
// configured Kafka topic so that the notification backend can process them and
// create email notifications based on the provided events.
//
// Additionally ServiceLog events are created, these can be displayed on
// cluster pages. Currently the events are only created for the *important* and
// *critical* issues found in the new_reports table of the configured
// PostgreSQL database. Once the reports are processed, the DB is updated with
// info about sent events by populating the reported table with the
// corresponding information. For more info about initialising the database and
// perform migrations, take a look at the
// https://github.com/RedHatInsights/ccx-notification-writer.
//
// In the instant notification mode, one email will be received for each
// cluster with important or critical issues.
//
// Additionally this service exposes several metrics about consumed and
// processed messages. These metrics can be aggregated by Prometheus and
// displayed by Grafana tools.
